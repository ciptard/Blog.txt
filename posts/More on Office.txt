More on Office for iPad
John Gruber briefly explaining why Apple will most likely not show off Microsoft's Office suite for iPad:
<blockquote cite="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/22/office-ipad-keynote">why share the spotlight with Microsoft? Apple doesn't need to.</blockquote>
And a bit more from <a href="http://twitter.com/tapbot_paul">Paul Haddad</a> on why I hope Office doesn't come to the iPad:
<blockquote cite="">Office for iPad: I imagine a 5GB download, 2 minute launch time, incompatible file format and $150 price point.</blockquote>
Paul's obviously joking, but I do see Microsoft doing stuff like this.
