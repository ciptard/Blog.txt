	A really interesting read about how Apple succeeds by NOT listening to us, but rather us listening to Apple. Like Steve Jobs said about the customer not knowing what they want until they are shown what they really want.

	This here is an interesting bit, similar to what Steve Jobs said:
<blockquote>I obviously believed in listening to customers, but customers can't tell you about the next breakthrough that's going to happen next year that's going to change the whole industry.</blockquote>It's not entirely discrediting market research. But market research should only be for fine tuning parts of a product for usability purposes, not for creating a product from scratch. Take the iPad for example, some mocked it at first, but now it can be seen to be <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ry5lzHJcr7M/Te8dkLQC7CI/AAAAAAAAXD0/k9qmG3SI0N4/s1600/chart-of-the-day-ipad-sales.jpg">incredibly successful</a>.
