Apparently, Microsoft is planning to release an iPad version of their popular software suite, Office. I am surprised Microsoft hadn't done this earlier. Office is a huge name and it would/will sell quite well on the App Store. However, at the same time I'm not surprised it took them so long to see the App Store as a goldmine after seeing their CEO <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U">laugh at the iPhone announcement</a> back in 2006. The problem I have with MS Office is that a lot of consumers tend to think MS Office is the <i>only</i> document editing software suite. A large portion of consumers fail to realise there are numerous of other options, including free ones. It pains me to see people running MS Office on a Mac but never heard of Apple's solution: iWork. I don't mean to sound biased, but Apple's solution is far superior than Microsoft's (on OS X), and cheaper. I would hate to see the same thing happen on iOS.
