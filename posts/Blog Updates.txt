<h1 class='title'>Blog Updates</h1>
<p>I added URL arguments! Add ?page=x after page numbers (hint: they start and default at 0). ?postsPerPage= also works. There are just a few things I'm worried about with these, though. I'm working on making a ?post= for specific, individual posts, but unfortunately you can go back/up directories. I'm going to have to make sure it only displays files within the /posts directory, $dir. Now I should work on getting a working RSS Feed.</p>
