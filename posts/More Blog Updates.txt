<h1 class='title'>More Blog Updates</h1>
<p>I have links for pages working now, but it makes me wonder whether I should use '<' and '>' or 'Previous' and 'Next' or 'Older' and 'Newer'. Either way, I've got the functionality working so I can think about which one makes more sense. I may even create that 'infinite' scrolling, but with URL arguments.</p>
